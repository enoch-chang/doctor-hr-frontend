# doctor-hr-frontend
This is a front-end React application of a heart rate monitor. It communicates with a server to provide real-time output of heart rates for a specified user e-mail input. The retrieved information is tabulated and plotted onto a graph.

## Installation

First, change directory into the ```react-learning``` folder:
```
cd react-learning
```

Install all required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the front end application, run the following code:
```
npm run start
```

The front end application requires a back-end server (found [here](https://github.com/enoch-chang/heart_rate_databases_starter)) to be fully functional. 

## How to Use

Type the patient e-mail into the text field and click "GET DATA". The heart rates for the specified user will be returned in the table and graph below.
