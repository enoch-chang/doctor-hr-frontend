# doctor-hr-frontend
This is the front-end component of a heart rate monitor built using ReactJS. It communicates with a server to provide real-time output of heart rates for a specified user e-mail input. The retrieved information is tabulated and plotted onto a graph.

## Installation and Deployment

First, change directory into the ```react-learning``` folder:
```
cd react-learning
```

Install all required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the front end application, run the following code:
```
npm run start
```

The front end application requires a back-end server (found [here](https://github.com/enoch-chang/heart_rate_databases_starter)) to be fully functional.
